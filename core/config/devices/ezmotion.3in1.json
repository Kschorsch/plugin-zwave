This feature only prevents the lights from coming on when motion is first detected and the light level in the room is already above Light Threshold. It will not turn the lights off when the amount of natural light in the room increases. It will automatically turn on the lights in a room that has motion in it and that the amount of natural light has dropped be low Light Threshold. A value of 100% turns off this feature. Recommended values: Usually a value between 40% and 60% will prevent th e lights from coming on in a reasonably well light room and will turn them on as it is getting dark.
